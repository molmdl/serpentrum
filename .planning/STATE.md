# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-06)

**Core value:** Playing snake by stacking real molecules with known stacking geometry, then seeing the IR spectrum of the molecule you assembled, computed end-to-end inside PyMOL via xtb.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Plugin Skeleton & Purity Harness

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Plugin Skeleton & Purity Harness)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-06 — Roadmap created (8 phases, 44/44 v1 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Locked 2026-09-06: 2D plane + locked camera; constant speed; rigid chain pivot turns (GAME-10 — sweep refused on collision, no 180°)
- Locked 2026-09-06: Demo Set A only (π-stack); distances pinned at data-prep + human approval; refuse-and-skip fallback (STACK-03)
- Locked 2026-09-06: `xtb --ohess` (never `-o --hess`); broadened IR; static mode vectors; 6 buttons; crash still completes → spectra
- Roadmap 2026-09-06: Phase 6 (xtb pipeline) depends only on Phase 2 — run parallel with Phases 3–5; worktree protocol for concurrent plans
- Roadmap 2026-09-06: v1 requirement count corrected 41 → 44 (listed ID ranges sum to 44; all mapped exactly once)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Demo-data approval track (human-gated) starts at Phase 2 and gates Phase 8 (DATA-02) — longest external lead time; must not slip.
- Phase 4 spike: up/down arrow-key binding is the one open mechanism question (Qt event-filter fallback already designed).
- Phase 6 calibration pending: QProcess-in-conda smoke, ~100-atom `--ohess` wall time, OMP env (`[TRAIN]`).
